Phenotypes
==========

A "phenotype" defines merely the physical appearance of a class of characters, it's not related to politics, culture, language or history. It's used to describe the variations of human traits in relation to the evolution in a specific geographical area.

MB-Lab supports the most of common human phenotypes to the extent of volumetric modeling features.

The phenotypes are labeled using the geographic location where each phenotype is statistically more diffused.

The available phenotypes depend by the base character selected:
